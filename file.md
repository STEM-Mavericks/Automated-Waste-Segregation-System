Automated Waste Segregation System
Overview
This app is made user-friendly, so user can use our model efficently and bring impact on environment to keep clean surroundings

Features

Automated Segregation: The system uses a moisture sensor to figure out if the waste is wet or dry, then sends it to the right compartment.
Weight Check: Keeps track of how much waste you’re generating with a load sensor, making sure the bin doesn’t get too heavy.
Bin Capacity Monitoring: An ultrasonic sensor checks how full the bin is and alerts you when it's almost time to empty it, so there's no overflow mess.
Real-Time Updates: The web app shows you live data on how the waste is being sorted, bin capacity, and waste weight. You’ll also get instant alerts to take action when needed.
Waste Analytics: Want to see how much waste you’re producing? The system generates daily, weekly, and monthly reports to help you understand and manage your waste habits.
Built to Last: This system is designed to handle everything, from damp weather to dry, dusty environments. For homes, malls.

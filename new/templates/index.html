    <h4>Smart Dustbin System</h4>
    <p>Many people struggle with sorting waste correctly because it can be boring. To fix this, we're creating a smart dustbin that automatically separates wet and dry waste. Our project uses moisture sensors to detect the type of waste and sort it into the right compartments. This helps make recycling and disposal more efficient, reduces landfill use, and supports a cleaner, more sustainable environment. This will raise awareness and encourage people to dispose of waste properly.</p>
    <p>In the system, there will be a load sensor to measure the weight of the waste in the dustbins. The website will display all the system data, helping users recover lost items if accidentally thrown away. The dustbin will also feature an LCD that shows the weight of the waste in kilograms, enabling users to track their daily waste production.</p>

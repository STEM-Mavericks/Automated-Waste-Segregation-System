# Automated Waste Segregation System

## Overview

The **Automated Waste Segregation System** is designed to enhance waste management efficiency by automating the segregation of dry and wet waste. The system uses a combination of sensors and actuators to detect moisture levels, measure waste weight, and monitor bin capacity, ensuring precise and effective waste segregation. It also provides real-time data visualization, alerts, and analytics via a user-friendly web application to promote responsible waste management and sustainability.

## Key Features

- **Automated Waste Segregation**: Utilizes a moisture sensor to differentiate between dry and wet waste, directing each type to the appropriate compartment.
- **Weight Measurement**: Employs a load sensor to measure the weight of the waste, helping monitor waste generation and avoid overloading the bin.
- **Bin Capacity Monitoring**: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to continuously monitor the bin's capacity, alerting users when the bin is nearing full capacity to prevent overflow.
- **Real-Time Data and Alerts**: Features a web application that displays real-time data on waste segregation, bin capacity, and waste weight, along with alerts and notifications for timely waste disposal.
- **Detailed Waste Analytics**: Generates reports on waste production, including daily, weekly, and monthly metrics, to help users track and manage their waste generation patterns.
- **Durable and Adaptable Design**: Suitable for humid to arid environments, making it suitable for residential areas, public spaces, and industrial sites.

## Components

### Sensors

1. **Moisture Sensor**: Detects the moisture content of waste to classify it as wet or dry.
2. **Load Sensor**: Measures the weight of the waste in the bin to provide data for weight reports.
3. **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Monitors the level of waste in the bin and alerts users when the bin is nearly full.

### Actuators

- **Motorized Actuator**: Connected to a flap mechanism that segregates waste into designated compartments based on real-time data from the sensors.
- **Motor-Driven Conveyor or Sliding Mechanism**: Facilitates the movement of waste within the bin, enhancing the efficiency of the segregation process.

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The moisture sensor detects the moisture content of the waste to determine whether it is wet or dry.
2. **Segregation**: Based on the moisture content, the actuator moves the waste to the appropriate compartment.
3. **Weight Measurement**: The load sensor measures the weight of the waste and updates this data on the web app.
4. **Capacity Monitoring**: The ultrasonic sensor monitors the binâ€™s capacity, providing alerts when the bin is nearly full.
5. **Data Visualization**: The web app displays real-time data and analytics, helping users track waste generation and management.

## Real-Life Problems Solved

- **Improved Waste Sorting**: Automates the process of sorting dry and wet waste, reducing human error and increasing recycling efficiency.
- **Enhanced Waste Management**: Provides real-time monitoring and alerts to prevent bin overflow and maintain cleanliness.
- **Supports Sustainability**: Promotes recycling and reduces landfill waste, contributing to a cleaner environment.


## Future Improvements

- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app version of the web application for easier access and notifications.
